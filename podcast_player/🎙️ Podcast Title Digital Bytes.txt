Speaker A (Host):
"Hello everyone, and welcome to Digital Bytes! I’m your host, Ananya. In today’s episode, we’re diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence — what it is, why it matters, and how it’s changing our lives."

Speaker B (Guest):
"Hi Ananya, thanks for having me! I’m excited to talk about AI. It’s one of the most revolutionary technologies of our time."

Speaker A:
"Absolutely! Let’s start with the basics. What exactly is Artificial Intelligence?"

Speaker B:
"AI refers to machines or software that can mimic human intelligence. This includes learning from data, recognizing speech or images, and even making decisions."

Speaker A:
"That’s fascinating. We use AI in so many places now — from Google Maps to ChatGPT, right?"

Speaker B:
"Exactly. And AI is also helping doctors detect diseases early, automating industries, and even making our smartphones smarter."

Speaker A:
"But with great power comes great responsibility. What about the concerns around job losses or bias in AI?"
